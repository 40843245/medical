## pancreatic islet cells
### [pancreatic islet A cells(or called pancreatic islet alpha cells)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_cell)

> [!NOTE]
> In general, pancreatic islet A cells secrete glucagon. Eventually, blood sugar rises to a certain level.

+ In general, pancreatic islet A cells secrete glucagon. Glycgon binds to receptors in cells such as liver cells and kidney cells. During this process, glycogen phosphorylase in liver cells is activated to hydrolyze [Glycogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen) into glucose. This in turn raises blood sugar to a certain level.

+ In general, pancreatic islet A cells promote the active uptake of amino acids by hepatocytes and reduce the levels of [amino acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid) such as [alanine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine), [glutamic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_acid) and [glycine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycine).
  
+ In general, pancreatic islet A cells can promote the hydrolysis of adipose tissue and the oxidation of fatty acids, resulting in an increase in the level of free fatty acids in the blood. Finally, the liver takes up free fatty acids and stores some triglycerides, and in the process, a little keto acid is also produced.

### [pancreatic islet B cells (or called pancreatic islet beta cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_cell)
> [! NOTE]
> In general, pancreatic B cells secrete insulin. Eventually, blood sugar drops to a certain level.

+ In general, pancreatic B cells secrete insulin. Insulin binds to insulin receptors on the surface of target cells. Induce metabolic changes in cells, accelerate the utilization of glucose, and then reduce blood sugar to a certain extent.
  
+ During the above process, glucose in the blood will be transferred to the pancreatic B cells through the glucose transporter GLUT2, and then metabolized by the pancreatic B cells to produce [ATP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate)
