## The underlying cause of high blood sugar
+ Damaged pancreatic allet alpha cells -> Unable to produce enough insulin.
+ Insulin resistance is too high (i.e., insulin is not fully functioning) - > Even if enough insulin is secreted, the drop in blood sugar is limited.

> [!NOTE]
> 'Insulin impedance too high' is like 'too high resistance in a circuit', and the current may still be weak even if the voltage is high enough.
> 'Not being able to produce enough insulin' is like 'the voltage in the circuit is too low' and the current will be very small.

### The details about the underlying cause of high blood sugar
In the blood sugar article, it is mentioned that

> In general, pancreatic allet alpha cells secrete insulin, which acts to promote the conversion of glucose to hepatic sugar, which in turn lowers blood sugar to a certain level.

With this theory, we can deduce that

+ As long as the pancreatic islet alpha cells are damaged to a certain extent, they cannot secrete enough insulin, and the diabetes obtained because of this is currently classified as type 1 diabetes.
+ Diabetes mellitus due to high insulin resistance is currently classified as type 2 diabetes.

## The reason behind the high blood sugar
### Damaged pancreatic allet alpha cells
#### Possible factors
1. Autoimmune dysregulation: immune cells attack pancreatic islet alpha cells.
2. Overuse: Overuse of pancreatic islet alpha cells.

#### How to avoid it as much as possible?
Against 
> Autoimmune dysregulation: immune cells attack pancreatic islet alpha cells.

I can't think of a better way to do it

> early attention, early examination, early detection, and early treatment

Against
> Overuse: Overuse of pancreatic islet alpha cells.

That's the way I came up with it
> Avoid overusing it. Contain:
> 1. Lifestyle habits
> + Sleep habits: Don't stay up late (here refers to too little sleep) or insomnia (here refers to poor sleep quality (such as sleep interruption)), if you have insomnia, you may need to discuss it with your doctor and ask your doctor to arrange relevant tests.
>+ Eating Habits:
> - Avoid overeating (i.e., overeating), which will greatly increase the burden on pancreatic allet alpha cells (see the last section of [Key Factors in Diabetes: Insulin](https://www.commonhealth.com.tw/diabetes/article/8)), [Still Eating Fruit After Eating Enough? Beware of secondary physical damage!](蒼蘭鴿's video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6jg-YA0Fbs) may be helpful to everyone)
> - As long as you eat enough carbohydrates. Too many carbohydrates will also increase the burden on alpha cells, ([蒼蘭鴿 (his body is a little unhealthy) measured video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RztbqO4fUE8) may be helpful to everyone)
> - Appropriate intake of dietary fibre. ([蒼蘭鴿 (his body is a little unhealthy) test video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvQORZ5AmuY) may be helpful to everyone)
> - Eating order: Eat enough dietary fibre before eating enough carbohydrates, and then get enough protein. ([蒼蘭鴿 (whose body is a little unhealthy) test video 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAsRd-UEYsk) may be useful for people who are a little unhealthy)
> - Try to avoid foods with a high GI. Because of the relative intake of foods with a lower GI, blood sugar will rise too quickly, which will increase the amount of insulin secretion. (This also means that it will increase the burden on pancreatic islet alpha cells) ([Introduction of GI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index))
> - Limit intake of 'refined sugars' (e.g. 'fructose', 'glucose syrup', etc.). Because this will cause the blood sugar to rise too quickly, which will increase the amount of insulin secretion. (This also means that it will increase the burden on pancreatic islet alpha cells)

> [!NOTE]
> Note that I'm not talking about 'Glycogen'.

> + Posture :
>   - Body fat control (or to put it more simply, because weight is easier to measure, is to control your weight and keep it within the normal range of BMI as much as possible, [National Health Administration, Ministry of Health and Welfare](https://www.hpa.gov.tw/Pages/Detail.aspx?nodeid=542&pid=9737))
>   - Control your waist circumference so that it falls within the normal range of your BMI as much as possible, [National Health Administration, Ministry of Health and Welfare](https://www.hpa.gov.tw/Pages/Detail.aspx?nodeid=542&pid=9737)
> + Proper Exercise:
>   - to facilitate the increase of metabolism, thereby burning more calories.
> + Try to avoid sitting for long periods of time. There are many dangers to sitting for long periods of time. These include increasing the degree of varicose veins, etc. For details, see [Dangers of Sedentary Care](https://www.commonhealth.com.tw/article/66899)
> + Quit smoking: The tar in tobacco products can easily accumulate in blood vessels, increasing the rate of blood vessel blockage. In addition, according to the [WHO] (https://www.who.int/), there are many [harms](https://www.who.int/multi-media/details/mpower--warn-about-the-dangers-of-tobacco) of smoking.
> + Abstain from alcohol. Because alcohol needs the liver to metabolize, consuming too much alcohol can be harmful to the liver.
> + Health Check-up: Do regular health check-ups. In particular, diabetics or quasi-diabetics are advised to have regular health check-ups.

> [!NOTE]
> Note that only these are required for people who are in good health. For others, please see below.

> [!CAUTION]
> For patients with mild diabetes, children within the third degree of relative health and their siblings, and patients with diabetes. In addition to controlling blood sugar through the above suggestions.
> + It is also important to have regular health check-ups (although it has already been mentioned above that regular health check-ups are more important than healthy people, so I will mention them again here) and pay more attention to your health check-up report and discuss treatment strategies with your doctor.
> + Also pay special attention to the symptoms and signs of hyperglycemia (see below) and discuss the situation with your doctor.
> + I **recommend** that if you are not financially stressed and willing to spend some money, try to measure your blood sugar and blood pressure at least three times a day before and 20 minutes after meals (at least 6 times a day).
> + I also **suggest**, Talk to your doctor about the need for treatment (including [oral blood glucose medications](https://www.shh.org.tw/page/PharmDetail.aspx?seq_no=P1017) or [islet needles]( https://www.tmuh.org.tw/UploadFile/files/%E8%97%A5%E5%8A%91%E9%83%A8/%E7%94%A8%E8%97%A5%E8%AB%AE%E8%A9%A2%E4%B8%AD%E5%BF%83-%E8%A1%9B%E6%95%99%E5%96%AE%E5%BC%B5/202211/%E5%A4%96%E7%94%A8%E9%87%9D%E5%8A%91/9029-Tresiba%E8%AB%BE%E8%83%B0%E4%BF%9D%2C%20Ryzodeg%E8%AB%BE%E8%83%B0%E5%BE%B7%E8%83%B0%E5%B3%B6%E7%B4%A0%E6%B3%A8%E5%B0%84%E7%AD%86(FlexTouch).pdf))
> For this treatment, it needs to be treated properly according to the doctor's instructions.

> [! CAUTION]
> For children with moderate or higher diabetes, their children within the third degree of relative relative and their siblings. In addition to controlling blood sugar through the above suggestions.
> + Also you **must** discuss with your doctor whether you need this treatment.
> For this treatment, it needs to be treated properly according to the doctor's instructions.

The same topic is discussed above, so it will not be discussed here, see above section.

## [Symptoms related to hyperglycemia](https://www.commonhealth.com.tw/article/88003)
1. Ketoacidosis. (Clinical)
2. Hyperosmolality and hyperglycemia. (Clinical)

## [Symptoms of Hyperglycemia] (https://www.commonhealth.com.tw/article/88003)
### Typical symptoms of high blood sugar
1. Thirst -> Drink lots of water
2. Hunger -> Eat many things
3. Blurred vision
4. Excessive urination - > frequent urination
5. Headaches
6. Fatigue
7. Rapid weight loss (when there is no deliberate weight loss)
8. Skin infections
9. Wound healing slows
10. Recurrent inflammation of the gums
11. Recurrent inflammation of the urethra

> [!TIP]
> Turn 1st, 2nd , and 4th above into tips, 3 more (eat more, drink more, urinate more).

### Detailed descriptions of the symptoms of hyperglycemia
This will involve osmosis.

The concentration of glucose is 'higher' than that of water (in other words, glucose is a 'high-concentration solution' compared to water).

Depending on osmosis, for a glass of glucose water, the glucose molecules move towards the water molecules until the concentration is equilibrate.

Now it's time to pause and imagine the following scenario.

What happens if the blood vessels in the body are soaked in sugar water?

> a whole bunch of bad things happen.

> Glucose in the body travels to the water in the body and metabolizes its conjugates out. Therefore it will

> 1. Lots of urine -> frequent urination
> 2. Thirst -> Drink lots of water
> 3. There is not enough glucose, so you will feel hungry -> eat a lot of things
> 4. Rapid weight loss (because too much water and glucose are metabolized)
> 5. Prone to dehydration due to insufficient water intake (including: fatigue, headaches)

> In addition, blood vessels soaked in sugar water can be fragile ('''Think about why crispy plums bite so crispy'''). Therefore it will
> 1. Some blood vessels, such as the skin, are more susceptible to infection. The wound heals very slowly. This can explain why the following events occurred.

> ```
> skin infections
> Wound healing slows
> Recurrent inflammation of the gums
> Recurrent inflammation of the urethra 
> blurred vision (due to the bursting of microvessels such as the retina)
> ```

## Complications of long-term hyperglycemia
Complications of long-term hyperglycemia include:

1. [Diabetic retinopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_retinopathy): commonly known as 'diabetic eye disease'.
2. [Diabetic nephropathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_nephropathy): commonly known as 'diabetic kidney disease'.
3. [Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_neuropathy): Abbreviated as 'DPN'.
4. Diabetic foot: commonly known as 'diabetic foot', it is only a foot wound that is difficult to heal in the early stage, and if not treated properly, it can lead to amputation.
5. [Cardiovascular disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease): commonly known as 'diabetic heart disease'.

### A detailed description of the complications of long-term hyperglycemia
Read carefully the blockquote in the section '### Symptoms of high blood sugar' and think carefully about it, I believe you will know the reason behind it. Same as that content.
