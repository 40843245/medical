# Incretin
## Intro
Incretin is a hormone that is located in the intestines and is secreted by the intestines.

## Action
1. Enterin can stimulate secretion of insulin.
2. Enterin can also delay gastric emptying.

## Affect to sugar blood
For healthy people, only when the blood sugar reaches a certain level, the intestines secrete enterin, which in turn stimulates insulin secretion, which in turn lowers blood sugar to stabilize blood sugar.

## Other effects
1. Acting on the liver, it can reduce liver glucose generation and increase insulin sensitivity.
2. Acts on the stomach, slows down the rate of gastric emptying, and reduces hunger.
3. Acting on the pancreas, secreting more insulin when the body needs insulin, and reducing secretion when the need is less, so as to avoid hypoglycemia.
4. Acts on the central nervous system, inhibits the appetite center of the brain, produces a sense of satiety, and avoids excessive eating.

## Diabetes
However, if the intestinal secretion of enterin is insufficient when the blood sugar reaches a certain level, the insulin will not be enough, and the blood sugar will be lowered to a limited extent.

In some patients with diabetes, it may be found that the intestinal secretion of enterin is insufficient when the blood sugar level reaches a certain level.
