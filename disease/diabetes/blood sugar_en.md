# Blood sugar
## MOA of controlling blood sugar 
> In general, when the blood sugar rises to a certain level, the pancreatic A cells (or called pancreatic alpha cells) in the body will secrete insulin and play the role of insulin to lower the blood sugar to a certain level.

> In general, when the blood sugar drops to a certain level, the pancreatic B cells (or called pancreatic beta cells) in the body will secrete glucagon and play the role of glugon to raise the blood sugar to a certain level.

> In general, when stressed (eg, chased by a dog), adrenaline is secreted, causing blood sugar to rise.

## [MOA for digesting food](https://www.commonhealth.com.tw/diabetes/article/66)
1. When food enters the intestines, the cells in the intestines secrete hormones called enterin (GIP and GLP-1)
2. This enterin inhibits α cells of the pancreas to reduce the secretion of glucagon.
3. Enterin also stimulates β cells in the pancreas, prompting more insulin to be secreted, which may help protect pancreatic islet cells.
