# Blood sugar
## MOA of controlling blood sugar 
> In general, when the blood sugar rises to a certain level, the pancreatic A cells (or called pancreatic alpha cells) in the body will secrete insulin and play the role of insulin to lower the blood sugar to a certain level.

> In general, when the blood sugar drops to a certain level, the pancreatic B cells (or called pancreatic beta cells) in the body will secrete glucagon and play the role of glugon to raise the blood sugar to a certain level.

> In general, when stressed (eg, chased by a dog), adrenaline is secreted, causing blood sugar to rise.
